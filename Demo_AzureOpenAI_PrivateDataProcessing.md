## Instructions: Using Azure OpenAI’s Chat Playground with GPT-4o for Private Data Processing

#### Step 1: Provision Azure OpenAI Service with GPT-4o
1. **Create an Azure OpenAI Service Instance**:
   - In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to **Create a resource** and select **Azure OpenAI**.
   - Choose your subscription, resource group, and region. Select the **GPT-4o model** (or “ChatGPT-4”) as your model deployment option.

2. **Configure Access Keys**:
   - After creating the instance, go to **Keys and Endpoint** within your Azure OpenAI Service settings.
   - Copy the **API key** and **endpoint URL** for later use.

3. **Deploy the Model**:
   - Deploy GPT-4o by navigating to the **Model deployments** section, selecting GPT-4, and following the deployment steps. 

#### Step 2: Prepare Client Data for Analysis
- **Data Format**: For the Chat Playground, it’s best to prepare data in a structured, readable format, such as JSON snippets or summarized text entries.
- **Data Privacy**: Minimize sensitive information. Aggregate or anonymize details if possible to align with best practices for data privacy.

#### Step 3: Access the Chat Playground

1. **Navigate to the Chat Playground**:
   - In the Azure OpenAI resource, select **Chat Playground** under the model section.
   - Choose **GPT-4o** as the model in use.

2. **Input Data for Processing**:
   - Click Add data source.
   - In the Select data source dropdown select Azure Blog Storage (preview)
   - In the Select Azure Blob Storage resource dropdown select pdmaistorage
   - In the Select storge container drop-down select fileupload-clientdat
   - Below the Select Azure AI Search resrouce drop-down click Create a new Azure AI Search resource.
   - On the create a search service page select the AOAI reource group.
   - Enter pdmsearchai as the Service name.
   - Enter West US as the Location
   - Change the pricing tier to Basic
   - Click Review and Create
   - Click Create
   - back on the Add data page click the refresh button next to the Select Azure AI Search resource drop-down
   - Select pdmsearchai in the Azure AI Search resource drop-down
   - enter uploadedfiles as the Index Name
   - Leave Indexer schedule set to Once
   - Click Next
   - Click Next on the Data management page
   - On the Data connection page Select API key
   - Click Next
   - On the Review and finish page click Save and close

   - **Example Prompt**:
     ```plaintext
     Analyze the provided transaction data. Summarize key trends in sector performance, identify any patterns in buying or selling behavior, and provide an overall sentiment analysis for the client’s portfolio.
     ```

3. **Ask for Insights**:
   - After providing the client data, add a request like:
     ```plaintext
     Please provide insights on sector trends, buying and selling behavior, and the overall sentiment of this transaction.
     ```
   - The Chat Playground will generate responses based on the data, offering insights on patterns, sector performance, or sentiment for each entry.

#### Step 4: Review and Store Insights
- **Copy Results**: Copy the insights generated for each transaction.
- **Document**: Record responses in your data repository (e.g., add insights to a new column in your CSV or save to a database) for further reporting or visualization.

#### Tips for Using the Chat Playground Efficiently
- **Data Batching**: Combine multiple entries for sector-wide analysis to reduce prompt entries and save time.
- **Use Summarized Prompts**: Request high-level insights, such as trends across sectors, to avoid sending large data in individual entries.
- **Automate**: For large datasets, consider switching to an API-based process in the future, but the Chat Playground offers an accessible starting point for manual data analysis.

### Compliance and Privacy Advantages
By processing data within **Azure OpenAI’s Chat Playground**, data remains private, is not retained for model training, and benefits from Azure’s secure infrastructure. This method provides control over data visibility and ensures compliance with privacy standards.
