### How to Use These APIs with AutoML:
You can connect your AutoML model to any of these APIs by fetching data via an HTTP request, storing it in a data warehouse, and using it to train your model. Most APIs return data in JSON format, which is easy to parse and convert into a format like CSV or DataFrame, which most ML frameworks accept.
