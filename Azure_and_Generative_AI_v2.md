::: notes
**Visual**: Diagram showing the key components of cloud computing.

**Defining cloud computing**  
Cloud computing allows users to access servers, storage, and applications over the internet, instead of maintaining physical hardware.

**Benefits of cloud technology**  
The cloud provides businesses with cost-effective and scalable solutions, allowing them to increase or decrease resources as needed, while also benefiting from the security and innovation of cloud providers.

**Key components**  
Cloud infrastructure consists of three main components: Compute (processing power), Storage (data storage), and Networking (connectivity between resources).

:::

## **Types of Cloud Deployments**

- Public Cloud
    * Shared infrastructure accessible over the internet, owned by a cloud provider.
- Private Cloud
    * Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, providing greater control over resources.
- Hybrid Cloud
    * Combines both public and private cloud elements, allowing businesses to run workloads on-premises and in the cloud.

::: notes
**Visual**: Venn diagram comparing public, private, and hybrid cloud models.

**Public Cloud**  
Public cloud infrastructure is managed by cloud service providers, and customers access resources over the internet.

**Private Cloud**  
In private clouds, an organization owns and operates its own infrastructure, which allows for greater security and customization.

**Hybrid Cloud**  
A hybrid cloud approach allows businesses to use both on-premises infrastructure and public cloud services to meet specific business requirements.

:::

## **Cloud Adoption: A Leadership Perspective**

- Developing a cloud adoption strategy
    * Leaders must define workloads to migrate first, considering business goals.
- Aligning cloud initiatives with business goals
    * Cloud adoption should directly support larger objectives such as cost optimization and enhanced customer experience.
- Overcoming challenges
    * Common challenges include security concerns and organizational resistance, which can be addressed through training and transparent communication.

::: notes
**Visual**: Flowchart outlining the steps for cloud adoption.

**Developing a cloud adoption strategy**  
Leadership should prioritize which workloads to move to the cloud first, based on factors such as cost-effectiveness and operational needs.

**Aligning cloud initiatives with business goals**  
Cloud adoption is most successful when it is aligned with key business objectives, such as improving customer satisfaction, reducing costs, or increasing innovation.

**Overcoming challenges**  
Resistance to cloud adoption can come from concerns over security, costs, or lack of understanding. These challenges can be mitigated through clear communication, training, and security best practices.
