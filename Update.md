  - **Region**: Select the Azure region closest to you for reduced latency.  
  - **Storage Account, Key Vault, Application Insights**: Either create new ones or let Azure create them automatically for you.  
  - Click **Review + Create** and then **Create** to provision the workspace. This process may take a few minutes.

***Step 3: Upload your dataset***  
Once the workspace is ready, navigate to the **Assets** section on the left menu and select **Data**. Click **Create** to add a new dataset:  
  - **Data Type**: On the DataType page, give the dataset a name and choose **File** as the data source type.  
  - **Data Source**: Select **From local files** and click **Next**.  
  - **Destination Storage Type**: Accept the defaults and click **Next**.  
  - **File Selection**: Click the **Upload File** button, find and select your **CustomerChurn.csv** file from your local machine, and click **Next**.  
  - **Schema & Review**: Review the settings, adjust any schema details if needed, then click **Create** to upload the dataset.
