### 1. **Customer Churn Dataset**
   - **Use Case**: Predict which customers are likely to leave a service.
   - **Description**: This dataset contains customer demographics, usage metrics, and account information, which can be used to predict customer churn.
   - **Data Source**: You can use the **"Telco Customer Churn"** dataset available on **Kaggle** ([Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)).
   - **Columns**: It includes features like customer tenure, payment method, monthly charges, contract type, etc., which are great for classification tasks.

### 2. **Sales Forecasting Dataset**
   - **Use Case**: Forecast sales based on historical data.
   - **Description**: This dataset includes information on historical sales data by product, region, and time, and can be used to forecast future sales.
   - **Data Source**: You can use the **"Store Item Demand Forecasting"** dataset available on **Kaggle** ([Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data)).
   - **Columns**: Contains date, store ID, item ID, and sales. This dataset is ideal for **time-series forecasting** using AutoML.

### 3. **Financial Credit Risk Dataset**
   - **Use Case**: Predict the likelihood of loan default.
   - **Description**: This dataset includes information on credit applicants, such as income, employment status, and credit history, which can be used to classify credit risk.
   - **Data Source**: The **"German Credit Data"** dataset is available on **UCI Machine Learning Repository** ([Link to Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)).
   - **Columns**: It includes features such as age, job type, loan amount, duration, and default status, which are suitable for **classification tasks**.

### 4. **Marketing Campaign Dataset**
   - **Use Case**: Analyze the success of marketing campaigns.
   - **Description**: This dataset contains customer data, past purchase behavior, and information about multiple marketing campaigns. It can be used to predict campaign success.
   - **Data Source**: You can use the **"Bank Marketing"** dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** ([Link to Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)).
   - **Columns**: It includes data on customer demographics, previous campaign contacts, and campaign response (success or failure). This dataset is good for **classification** problems.

### Suggested Dataset for Your Demo:
I recommend using the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset for the Azure AutoML demo, as it is well-suited for a business insights use case and straightforward for demonstrating the following:
- **Classification tasks** (predicting churn status).
- Easily relatable business scenario.
- Features such as **customer demographics, tenure, and contract type**, which align well with real-world business questions.

### Steps to Use the Dataset:
1. **Download the Dataset**: Visit the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and download the CSV file.
2. **Upload to Azure ML Studio**: Upload the dataset to **Azure Machine Learning Studio**.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Make sure the target column (`Churn`) is correctly identified for the **classification** task.
   - Azure AutoML will automatically analyze the data and suggest transformations if necessary.

This dataset will allow you to demonstrate how AutoML can:
- **Automatically train and evaluate models**.
- **Select the best model** based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Deploy the model** for use in predicting customer churn, which is a highly relatable business application.
