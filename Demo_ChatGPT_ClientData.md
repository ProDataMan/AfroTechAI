### **Step 1: Prepare Mock Transaction Data**

Create a sample dataset with transaction details for a hypothetical client’s portfolio. Here’s an example dataset format with 10–20 entries:

| Date       | Transaction Type | Sector       | Amount ($) | Security           | Price | Quantity | Total Value ($) | Sentiment |
|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|--------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 2024-01-15 | Buy              | Technology   | 5000       | AI Tech Inc.       | 50    | 100      | 5000            | Positive  |
| 2024-01-16 | Sell             | Financial    | 3000       | FinGrowth LLC      | 30    | 100      | 3000            | Negative  |
| 2024-02-01 | Buy              | Energy       | 7000       | SolarWave Corp.    | 70    | 100      | 7000            | Positive  |
| 2024-02-05 | Dividend         | Technology   | 200        | AI Tech Inc.       | —     | —        | 200             | Neutral   |
| 2024-02-15 | Buy              | Healthcare   | 10000      | HealthPlus Inc.    | 100   | 100      | 10000           | Positive  |
| 2024-03-10 | Buy              | Technology   | 3000       | CloudData Inc.     | 150   | 20       | 3000            | Positive  |
| 2024-03-20 | Sell             | Retail       | 4000       | RetailX            | 40    | 100      | 4000            | Negative  |
| 2024-04-01 | Buy              | Financial    | 8000       | FinGrowth LLC      | 80    | 100      | 8000            | Positive  |
| 2024-04-15 | Dividend         | Energy       | 150        | SolarWave Corp.    | —     | —        | 150             | Neutral   |
| 2024-05-01 | Buy              | Technology   | 2000       | AI Tech Inc.       | 100   | 20       | 2000            | Positive  |

### **Step 2: Feed Data into a Generative AI Model**

Use the dataset to input into a generative AI model (such as GPT) and prompt it to generate a summary of insights based on the data provided.

#### Prompt Example:
- "Analyze the above transaction data. Summarize key trends in sector performance, identify any patterns in buying or selling behavior, and provide an overall sentiment analysis for the client’s portfolio."

### **Step 3: Expected AI-Generated Output**

**Example Output**:
> **Client Portfolio Summary – Q1 2024**
>
> - **Sector Performance**:
>   - *Technology*: The portfolio saw significant activity in the technology sector with notable buys in AI and cloud technologies, indicating a positive sentiment toward tech growth, especially in AI-driven companies.
>   - *Energy*: Solar investments demonstrated a growing interest in renewable energy with SolarWave Corp. contributing positively to portfolio diversification.
>
> - **Transaction Patterns**:
>   - *Buying Trends*: Majority of purchases are in Technology, Financial, and Energy sectors, showcasing a balanced approach between growth and stability.
>   - *Selling Trends*: Sells mainly occurred in Financial and Retail sectors, which may suggest divestment in less promising areas.
>
> - **Sentiment Analysis**:
>   - Positive sentiment across Technology and Healthcare investments indicates strong confidence in these areas, particularly AI, cloud services, and healthcare technology.
>   - The portfolio sentiment appears generally positive, aligned with growth-oriented sectors, suggesting a strategic focus on long-term, high-value industries.

### **Step 4: Display Output in a Dashboard Format**

Use a simple dashboard or visual display to showcase key findings, with sections for **Sector Performance**, **Transaction Patterns**, and **Sentiment Analysis**. 

For the demo, you can either:
- Use a presentation slide with highlighted insights, graphs, or charts based on the AI-generated summaries.
- Use a Jupyter notebook or similar tool to dynamically display the summarized text and graphs.

### **Step 5: Extend with an Interactive Q&A**

Allow for questions and show how the model can adapt to follow-up questions. Examples:
- “What are the top performing sectors?”
- “Which investment has the highest return?”
